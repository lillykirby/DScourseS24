\begin{enumerate}
    \item The data source I am most interested in scraping at the moment is the NIH RePORTER API (https://api.reporter.nih.gov/), which contains information on clinical trials and their total costs and funding. This was a resource I planned to use for my term paper last semester, but never got around to due to limitations on the sample of my other data. Aside from that, I would like to scrape legal records on Paragraph IV filing pharmaceutical cases, but I do not know of any free access legal databases.
    \item \textbf{Q5 Part D.} The date variable is a character.
    \item \textbf{Q5 Part E.} You can use the \textit{head()} command to display the first \textit{n} rows, where \textit{n} goes in the command.
